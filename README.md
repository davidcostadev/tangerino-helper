# TIPS
 - You can get your **EMPLOYER_CODE** by checking the very first TANGERINO email you received, or by asking HR.
 - **PIN** is the 4 digit number you use punch in and out every day.
 - **USER_NAME** is a string with your name. You can copy this from the email you receive every time you punch in/out under the field 'Funcion√°rio'.

Your '.env' should look similar to this:
```
EMPLOYER_CODE=ASD2Y
PIN=1234
USER_NAME='John Doe'
```







## Output Example

```
balance
previous month: 00:55 CREDIT
current month: -04:41 DEBT
